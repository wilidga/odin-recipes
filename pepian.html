    <h2>Recado de Pepian Indio (Guatemalan Pepian Indio Sauce)</h2>
    <p>Pepian is among the 4 national dishes of Guatemala. Pepian is hot, hearty, simple, yet complex. In Guatemala, pepian has as many variations as there are cooks. Here is my recipe for a simpler version of this sauce. Serve with white rice.</p>
